# Taskbox - Storybook Tutorial Project

This project was developed as part of my internship at [Foothill Technology Solutions](https://github.com/FoothillSolutions). The purpose of this repository is to showcase what I've learned from the [Intro to Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/) tutorial, which focuses on building UI components with Storybook in a React application.

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the Storybook tutorial, covering the setup, building components, adding data, and deploying Storybook.

### Features Learned

- **Chromatic Integration**: Set up [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) for UI testing and visual regression tests.
- **Deployment**: Learned how to deploy Storybook to Chromatic.
- **Writing Stories**: Developed stories in a bottom-up approach, starting from atomic task component to complex task list screen.
- **Error & Loading States**: Implemented and handled error and loading states in the Task component.
- **Inbox Screen**: Created an Inbox screen that displays the entire task list using Storybook.
